# Row Level Security for Ruby on Rails

Row Level Security (RLS) is a feature of PostgreSQL
(see [PG Docs: About RLS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-rowsecurity.html) and
[PG Docs: CREATE POLICY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createpolicy.html))
that allows you to define rules to check whether SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or
DELETEs are accessing or creating legitimate rows.

RLS gives your application a second line of defense when isolating data in 
a multi-user application. A mistake in the rapidly changing application code 
may easily leak data or introduce severe security threads. With RLS PostgreSQL
always double checks whether the data going in or out complies with the defined policies.

## Compatibility
This gem is tested with Ruby 2.7 and Ruby 3.0 against Rails 6.0, 6.1 and 7.0.


Tests for Ruby 3.1 are not running due to a problem with psych 4.0 which is responsible for loading 
the ruby-interpolated database.yaml configuration (details [here](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/17866)).
This does not mean this Gem is not compatible with Ruby 3.1, it may be anyway, we haven't tried yet. PRs welcome ;-)


## Usage
### Migrations
- `enable_rls(table, force: false)`: Enables RLS for `table`. Option `force` yields to application of RLS for the table owner himself as well.
- `disable_rls(table, force: false)`: Disables (`force`full ) RLS for `table`.
- `create_policy(table, version: 1)`: Creates a policy for given table.
- `drop_policy(table, version: nil)`: Drops all existing policies defined for `table`.
- `update_policy(table, version: nil, revert_to_version: nil)`: Drops all existing policies for `table` and creates the latest policies (can be overriden by `version`)

### Policy Definition
All policies for a table are defined in a single file. Policy-definitions are versioned in a 
similar manner like SQL-views by [scenic](https://github.com/scenic-views/scenic) (which 
strongly inspired rls_rails).
The following example resides eg. under `db/policies/accounts/accounts_v01.rb`
```ruby
RLS.policies_for :accounts do
  policy :my_policy do
    restrictive           # AS-part of policy, permissive is default
    on :select, :update   # FOR-part of policy, default is :all
    to :psql_user         # TO-part of policy, default is :public
    
    using <<-SQL
      -- USING-part goes here
    SQL
    
    check <<-SQL
      -- CHECK-part goes here
    SQL
  end
  
  policy :another_policy do
    # ...
  end
end
```

By default all policies can be "disabled" manually. If you wish to prevent this 
behaviour you can do `RLS.policies_for :table, disableable: false do ...`

### Setting tenants

The module `RLS` provides some methods for working and controlling RLS: 

* `RLS.set_tenant(tenant)` Sets the current tenant
* `RLS.disable!` Turns off RLS (does not reset the current tenant)
* `RLS.enable!` Turns on RLS again (default is RLS enabled)
* `RLS.disable_for_block { ... }` Disable RLS for the given block
* `RLS.set_tenant_for_block(tenant) { ... }` Run a block as a given tenant
* `RLS.run_per_tenant { |tenant| ... }` Run a block once for each existing tenant, useful for data migrations
* `RLS.enabled?` Returns true if RLS is not manually disabled
* `RLS.disabled?` Returns true if RLS is manually disabled
* `RLS.status` Returns the current status of RLS: `{tenant_id: <current_tenant_id>, disable_rls: <rls_disabled>}`
* `RLS.current_tenant` Returns the object of the current tenant
* `RLS.current_tenant_id` Returns the id of the current tenant
* `RLS.reset!` Resets the current RLS setting (tenant_id + rls_disabled)



### Shorthands
There are some shorthands you can use to define a policy that follows a common pattern:

#### Use `tenant_id` to check whether a row is accessible by the current tenant
```ruby
RLS.policies_for :users do
  using_tenant
end
```

#### Allow access if a a relation via belongs_to is accessible
```ruby
RLS.policies_for :posts do
  using_relation :topic
end
```

#### Allow access if _all_ of the given relations are accessible
```ruby
RLS.policies_for :abbonements do
  using_relations :user, :topic                    # foreign keys are guessed
  using_relations user: User, topic: Topic         # Explicit relation classes, FK is obtained via `table_name`
  using_relations user: :user_id, topic: :topic_id # explicit foreign keys
end
```

#### Allow access if there is a join partner in the other table with the current tenant id
```ruby
RLS.policies_for :abbonements do
  using_table :level_memberships, match: :level_id # primary key = foreign key
  using_table :level_memberships, primary_key: :level_id, foreign_key: :level_id, tenant_id: :tenant_id
end
```

#### Shorthand to create a policy that admits rows that find a join partner in another table
```ruby
RLS.policies_for :group_memberships do
  check_table :people, primary_key: :person_id, foreign_key: :id do
    using "TRUE"
  end
end
```

## Enabling and disabling RLS
By default, the owner of a table is not affected by RLS. As migrations create tables, it will
also be owner of the table, rendering RLS useless when not maintaining multiple 
database-users and connection. This is cumbersome, therefore RLS is forced so that the owner
is affected as well by the policies and RLS is controlled by an session-variable.
Two PostgreSQL  functions are created to handle RLS: `current_tenant_id()` which 
returns the id of the current tenant set by `SET rls.tenant_id = 42;` or raises an error if unset.
The other function is `rls_disabled()` that returns `TRUE` if `SET c2.rls_disabled = TRUE` 
is set, otherwise `FALSE`. Note that these variables are set on a connection level.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rls_rails', github: 'sbiastoch/rls_rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ rails g rls_rails:install
```

The latter command will create a migration that sets up two PostgreSQL User-Defined Functions (UDFs) that are usefull
when using policies: `current_tenant_id()` telling the current tenant_id as BIGINT and `rls_disabled` returning TRUE
when RLS was disabled by `SET rls.disable TO TRUE`, otherwise FALSE.

If you are already using RLS and have some policies within your `db/structure.sql` 
you can use `rails rls_rails:init` to populate `db/policies` with the current policies rewirtten in our own DSL. Note that 
this currently works only for simple USING and CHECK policies without any other modifiers.

## Tips

### Integration into Controllers

The UDF `current_tenant_id()` will raise an error if it is called without an tenant id set.
This requires you to take care of setting the current tenant or disabling RLS otherwise before
any RLS-protected table is accessed.

You can set the current tenant by including a `before_action :init_row_level_security` 
in the ApplicationController fetching the current tenant and initializing RLS, eg.:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :init_row_level_security

  def init_row_level_security
    # Devise is always called in a state where the user is not authenticated yet
    return RLS.disable! if devise_controller?

    if current_tenant
      RLS.set_tenant current_client
    else
      raise "ERROR: RLS not set up!"
    end
  end
end
```

__Notes on using with Devise with RLS-protected tables for authentication__\
If authentication in your application depends on querying RLS-protected tables, you need to 
disable RLS while authenticating users, resetting passwords etc.
For those using Devise, here are some tips:

All controllers of Devise inherit also from `ApplicationController` but unfortunately
Devise uses `prepend_before_action` which does prepend the action to the very beginning 
of the callback-queue. Since subclass-callbacks are registered after the ones from the 
superclass, the callback defined in a subclass by `prepend_before_action` is prepended _before_
the callback defined in the superclass by `prepend_before_action`.
Therefore we have to place the `prepend_before_action :init_row_level_security` directly 
in the concrete devise controllers to be executed at the very beginning.

Furthermore, Devises `authenticated`-route-helper kicks in before any controller is called, 
so you need hook into `User#serialize_from_session` that Devise uses to tests authentication 
and disable RLS for that method.


### Recursive policies
If a policy requires a direct or indirect self-join, you cannot use native RLS.
Self-referential (ie. "recursive") policies are not possible.

The standard alternate approach (that was used to simulate RLS before PostgreSQL 9.5) 
is to use an  automatically updateable view 
([PG Docs: Updateable Views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS)
) that filters out those rows that are not permissible to view for the given tenant. 
By `WITH CHECK CASCADE` on the view it is enforced that no rows are modified that does 
not meet the view-conditions. The `security_barrier` flag tells PostgreSQL, that it has to
take special measures to prevent a malicious function leaking data while filtering. For more
information about `security_barrier` see 
[PG Docs: Rules and Privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rules-privileges.html).

If you wondering if there are currently any tables without policies, you can check by
`SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND NOT rowsecurity`.


## Future Work

### Testing Policies
It would be great if the DSL would support a convenient way to test policies. This could be
done by CTEs mocking the actual tables and test each single policy independent from 
other policies. Test data could be automatically generated from the columns and tables used 
in the policy definition. The remaining task of the programmer would be to label rows he would 
expect to pass the policy definition.

### Signing session variables
To further secure RLS it is possible to use a 
[signing mechanism](https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/application-users-vs-row-level-security),
which mitigates attacks via SQL-injections. Currently, the attacker could disable RLS by a 
SQL injection and query all data. If the session variables for RLS are signed, the 
attacker needs also access to a secret on another system.
